### Hey, I'm Alexander Yue

I do high-energy physics at Stanford (co 2027) and work at <a href="https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use">Browser Use</a> (YC W25).

In my research at SLAC, I train foundation models on vast amounts of real collider data, and synthesize tiny models to run on eFPGAs within 25ns so they can be put directly on detectors. From this, I gained cutting edge experience in the emerging field of fast machine learning. 

At Browser Use I lead agent evaluations, analyzing data for realistic test sets, aligning models and LLM judges, managing large-scale infra for prod CI/CD, and building observability tools. My scientific research background means I put organization, documentation, reproducibility and experimental validity first.

I major in physics because solving challenging problems and building skills is my passion. I love to build because it is the best way to learn and improve. Throughout my life, I always want to continually improve, both my abilities and my character.  

Best,<br>
Alexander
